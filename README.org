* Lagtävling

Lagtävling is a web tool written in Python with the help of the Django
framework that helps you manage the results of your dog agility and
jumping competitions, where you combine two heats to get a final
result. It supports both individual starts and teams. It was made for
and used during the 2015 Swedish Dog Agility Championship.

This is specialized software made for a very specific need, and as
such it may not be applicate to your needs, even if you believe your
needs are similar.
